We are Robert Bl√ºmel, Desiree Gerritsen, Jiyun Sun and Giorgio Malinverni.

In this directory, you will find:
- the code to extract some syntactic features from textual data. It is included in a notebook called "all_features.ipynb". We suspected a notebook to be better than a main function because it presents much more clearly the feature extraction process.
- the test file which contains some text to get the extraction to run correctly. It is called "test.txt".
